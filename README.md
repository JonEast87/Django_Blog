# Meower-Microblog

> This blog is made using a combination of Python's Django backend framework and the frontend framework Bulma. Javascript has
> been limited in its use as I want to attempt something outside my normal scope of work.
> I plan on wrapping the project into an easy-to-use Docker file but in the meantime ~~this project has been deployed to heroku.com under
> https://meower-microblog.herokuapp.com~~ this project is currently unavailable in a live demo. After Heroku going to a paid service I pulled 
> it. I am looking for an alternative hosting service.
